# Decorator Design Pattern

## Overview
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behaviour and 
**functionality to be dynamically added to an object without affecting the behaviour of other objects in the same class**.
.Because it offers a wrapper to an existing class, the decorator design pattern is also known as Wrapper. To implement 
the wrapper, this approach uses abstract classes or interfaces with composition. Decorator classes are used to extend 
the functionality of the base class.
